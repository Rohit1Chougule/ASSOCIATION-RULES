Interview Questions:


1.	What is lift and why is it important in Association rules?

Ans-

Lift is a measure of the strength of the association between two items, taking into account the frequency of both items in the dataset. 
It is calculated as the confidence of the association divided by the support of the second item.
lift, can be used to compare observed confidence with expected confidence, or how many times an if-then statement is expected to be found true.


2.	What is support and Confidence. How do you calculate them?

Ans-

Support is calculated by dividing the number of transactions containing an item set by the total number of transactions.
Support indicates how frequently an item appears in the data.

Confidence is calculated by dividing the number of transactions containing both itemsets by the number of transactions containing the first itemset.
Confidence indicates the number of times the if-then statement is found to be true.

Calculation-  confidence(X ⇒ Y) = support(X ∪ Y) / support(X).




3.	What are some limitations or challenges of Association rules mining?


Ans-

Some of the main drawbacks of association rule algorithms in e-learning are: the algorithms have too many parameters for some in experienced person in data mining 
and the obtained rules are in abundance, most of them non-interesting and with low unambiguousness.
potential to generate an overwhelming number of rules from a large dataset, which can be costly and complex to analyze. 
To address this issue, you can use techniques to reduce the search space and filter out irrelevant or redundant rules.
